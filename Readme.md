# TPED Controls
Welcome to the TPED at Virginia Tech Controls repository for the 2024-2025 REC competition. If you do not have access to this and believe you should, please send an email to one of the team leads so that they can add you.

This code base is split into several sections. The various components which need to have independent profiles or where different langauges are used outline the majority of these barriers. Please refer to the following headings for more information on each one.

## Main Control Loop
The control loop is what will be used for the normal automation and operation of the ride. It is split into a few modes, **AUTO** and **MANUAL**.
### Auto
Auto mode allows the ride to run without interruption until the Ride Operator determines it to stop, or the Emergency Stop is pressed.
### Manual
Manual offers a more 'in control' feel, useful for debugging and testing, as well as performance testing and maintenance.
